WEBDEVT Midterm Project

This text file will be my source of documentation and anyone can see it
I wont be providing much but I may add various sites for experiments and research
Please bear in mind that I will use this a session log for my own personal purpose
To further enhance and develop my growth as a developer, I will create time stamps to guide me

The current Deadline of the Project is February 16, 2017 and I wont be posting any details as of what the project is
