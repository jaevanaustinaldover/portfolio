WEBDEVT Midterm Project

This text file will be my source of documentation and anyone can see it
I wont be providing much but I may add various sites for experiments and research
Please bear in mind that I will use this a session log for my own personal purpose
To further enhance and develop my growth as a developer, I will create time stamps to guide me

The current Deadline of the Project is February 16, 2017 and I wont be posting any details as of what the project is

February 4, 2017(13:00PHT)
Search various sites (mostly about javascripts) since I am lacking in that department of webdevelopment
Found various sites, interested the most in advance carousel/slide and button effects that seemed to be up my alley
No further code has been implemented but tried to test some things out, ill be adding my homepage this week and probably things about me

Almost done with the homepage, tried adding a loading screen for the site but had a few issues.

the homepage layout was forked from "https://tympanus.net/codrops/2016/08/10/multi-layout-slideshow/" by Mary Lou
added additional javascripts and css to simplify and changed containing images and information

starting some research and trying out other layouts for the other pages
