						Hello everyone, I'm Jae Van Austin Aldover. People call me Jazz or JV and I
						 was born on February 1998.
						I am a Catholic and I grew up in a nice household in Paranaque.
						People find me a tad too quiet and thinks I prefer to be alone. Little do they know
						that I dont mind hanging out with anyone as long as it's not a bother.
						Its just that I prefer to be alone at times since I enjoy that peace and quiet atmosphere
						. I studied at Malate Catholic School for most of my school years so I was
						 pretty well known in my alma mater.

						<p class="myp" style="color: #3e444f; font-size:29px;"><strong>
							Well I love listening to music, especially famous Classical Musicians such as Mozart,
							Bach, Chopin, Claude Debussy and Tchaikovsky. Besides Classical Music,
							I really enjoyed Post EDM and I support Indie Bands such as Barcelona, an all time favorite of mine.
							So I do like quiet places where I could think clearly without anyone ruining it. And I do enjoy nature 
							as it gave us stability and a place we can call home. I like books, especially mysteries because it makes
							me exercise my mind and makes me see new angles I have never seen before. I really like Science even though I was 
							never good at Physics. But I really enjoyed most of my Science classes especially Chemistry and Astronomy.

					<div><h1 class="introheader" id="mydislikes">Dislikes</h1><p style="font-size:29px;" class="myp"><strong>
							I always disliked unnecessary noise which distrubs not only me but also people around me.
							I never liked people who disrespects someone who never deserved to be disrepected. But I never really hated or bear a grudge just because I believe in karma.
							If I'm going to add more I probably just dont like people who continuously lie just to hide another lie. I believe it makes 
							the situation much worse and it can destroy relationships.

						<h1 class="introheader" style="color: #3e444f" id="mygoals">Goals and Dreams</h1>
						<p class="myp" style="color: #3e444f; font-size:29px;"><strong>
							So my personal goals are to finish my studies, work at a nice office with nice people, have my own house,
							share my blessings with my parents and siblings, and have a happy family of my own. It may be a simple goal but 
							it inspires me to do my best. My dreams are quite different though as I may or may not achieve them since I prioritize my goals.
							The dreams that I want to achieve are to finish up a Science course, possibly related to Chemistry, Biology, or even Astronomy since
							I really like Science. Another course that I want to take up are Art related Courses such as Multimedia Arts, Fine Arts or Music since
							those are the studies I truly wanted to finish. Another dream of mine is to reach Iceland, Iceland for me is the epitome of tranquility.
							Iceland is the most sparsely populated country in Europe, meaning you rarely see people in the outskirts of Reykjavik (Capital of Iceland).
							I want to go to Iceland at least once and live in a house for a week or 2 by myself so that I can reflect on what life has given me and what more can it offer.

					<div><h1 class="introheader">Personality</h1><p style="font-size:29px;" class="myp"><strong>
							I believe that a person's personality is built by two main things. From your genes, basically from your parents and your environment.
							My dad is really hot headed and really impatient but he prioritizes his family more than anything. My mom is quite the perfectionist since
							she aims to be punctual and precise especially when it comes to major life decisions but shared to us the value of being thankful and learning to fear the lord.
							 I believe that I got my dad's generosity and perseverance and my mom's careful and practical decision making and devotion to my religion. Add up that I grew in an environment where people come and go as they please
							 and that I never depended on my parents to do this and that. Anyways mix that all up and the outcome is me. I may be reserve and practical, but thats just me.
							 I am an ISFJ the Defender and/or INFJ the Advocate. Learn more about my personality here <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/personality-types" style="font-weight: bold; color: yellow;">Read More</a>
